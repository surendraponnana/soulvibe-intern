# 💡 SoulVibe Internship Project

## 🎓 Higher Education Course Data Analysis using SQL, Python & Power BI

Welcome! 👋
This repository showcases my data analytics project completed during the **SoulVibe internship**, where I explored and visualized higher education course data using a powerful stack: **MySQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aimed to uncover insights from a structured dataset on college courses across districts and universities. It combines the strength of:

* 🔍 **SQL** for advanced querying and data extraction
* 🐍 **Python** for data import automation and preprocessing
* 📊 **Power BI** for building interactive and insightful dashboards

---

## 🧠 What I Did

### 🔎 SQL Analysis

I wrote **20 well-crafted SQL queries** to answer real-world education-related questions. This involved:

* Complex **JOINs**
* Aggregations with **GROUP BY** and **HAVING**
* Ranking with **window functions**
* Insight extraction using **subqueries**

These queries helped explore institutional types, course durations, professional vs. non-professional programs, and specialization trends.

---

### 📊 Power BI Dashboards

After processing the data in MySQL, I connected it to **Power BI** to visualize the insights through:

* Dynamic **slicers**
* **Bar & pie charts**, line graphs, and tables
* KPIs on course categories, regional distribution, and university offerings

These dashboards allow stakeholders to interact with the data and quickly grasp key trends in higher education.
